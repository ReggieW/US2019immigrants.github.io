#US Fiscal Year 2019 Immigration


This is a final project for the Data Visualization Computer Science course at the University of Illinois. Specifications include creating a narrative visualization implemented as an interactive web page using knowledge of communication and narrative structures acquired throughout the course. The narrative visualization should be on a publicly visible website and can only be constructed using D3 (libraries permitted: D3-annotation and topoJSON Client) and JavaScript.
The data presented and dataset was acquired from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security publication library. The data is part of a series of quarterly reports ‘detailing the number of adjustments of immigration status that occurred during the’ 2019 fiscal Year reporting period. ‘Disaggregated by type of adjustment, type and detailed class of admission, and country of nationality’. 
I used the 2019 Fiscal Year report because it was most likely a more complete presentation of lawful immigration trends into the US prior to the Covid 19 outbreak.
